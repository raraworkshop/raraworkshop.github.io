          Documents serve as the backbone of knowledge preservation, decision-making, and information dissemination across domains such as law, finance, medicine, and academia. They encapsulate structured and unstructured data, requiring sophisticated processing to extract, synthesize, and verify critical insights. As AI-driven document understanding advances, ensuring factual accuracy, reasoning over complex contexts, and attributing information to reliable sources becomes increasingly vital.

The RARA workshop addresses persistent challenges in document processing that have been amplified in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). Extracting information from complex, multi-modal documents often requires reasoning over multiple sections, linking disparate pieces of evidence, and ensuring consistency across sources. Attribution remains a key issue, as models struggle to trace generated content back to reliable references, making verification difficult. While LLMs have improved contextual understanding, they also introduce risks such as hallucinations, overgeneralization, and opacity in their decision-making.
Our workshop explores frameworks that ground document understanding through four key emerging pillars

        </p>

  <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Structured mechanisms to navigate complex inference chains and resolve ambiguities
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Agents:</strong> Specialized components working together on complex tasks with access to executable tools
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Retrieval:</strong> Methods for finding and integrating relevant information to ground AI responses
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Attribution:</strong> Techniques to ensure AI-generated content remains traceable to reliable sources
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>
      We invite submissions to the first international workshop on <strong>Reasoning, Agents, Retrieval, and Attribution (RARA)</strong> for grounding documents, to be held in conjunction with <strong>ICDM 2025</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As documents continue to serve as the foundation of knowledge across domains like law, finance, healthcare, and academia, AI systems must develop more sophisticated capabilities to process, interpret, and reason over these complex information sources. The RARA workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of document understanding, reasoning systems, multi-agent architectures, and information retrieval to address key challenges in this rapidly evolving field.
    </p>

    <h4>Topics of Interest</h4>
    <p>We welcome original research papers on topics including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Complex Reasoning:</strong> Multi-hop inference across document sections, logical consistency maintenance, ambiguity resolution in domain-specific texts</li>
      <li><strong>Agent Architectures:</strong> Multi-agent coordination frameworks, tool-augmented document understanding, planning strategies for document analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Document-Specific Agents:</strong> Citation verification, fact-checking, table extraction, chart interpretation, formula extraction, document summarization and comparison agents</li>
      <li><strong>Domain-Specific Document Processing:</strong> Specialized techniques for legal, financial, healthcare, academic, technical, and government documents</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced Retrieval:</strong> Dense/sparse retrieval for multi-modal documents, cross-document information synthesis, retrieval-augmented generation for document processing</li>
      <li><strong>Attribution Mechanisms:</strong> Source tracing in AI-generated content, confidence calibration in document analysis, verification of AI-generated claims</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-Modal Processing:</strong> Handling diverse document formats including charts, tables, infographics, diagrams, flowcharts, forms, and other visually rich elements</li>
      <li><strong>Document Structure:</strong> Layout analysis, semantic segmentation, hierarchical document modeling</li>
      <li><strong>Benchmarks & Evaluation:</strong> Novel datasets, evaluation frameworks, metrics for document reasoning, attribution quality assessment, agent performance measurement</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <p>
      We welcome three types of papers: archival workshop papers, non-archival papers, and non-archival cross-submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the workshop proceedings. <i>Regular workshop submissions (both archival and non-archival)</i> should be in PDF format and made through the <b>OpenReview website</b> set up for this workshop 
      <a style="color:#2980b9;font-weight:400;" href="https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/NLRSE#tab-your-consoles">(link)</a>. In line with the ACL main conference policy, camera-ready versions of regular workshop papers will be given one additional page of content. <i>Non-archival cross-submissions</i> should be made through the <b>form</b> <a style="color:#2980b9;font-weight:400;" href="https://forms.gle/BKn4bczXfaXN7GSg7">(link)</a>.
        </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Archival regular workshop papers: </b>
      <!-- Authors should submit a paper up to <b>8 pages (both short and long papers are welcome)</b>, with unlimited pages for references, following the <a style="color:#2980b9;font-weight:400;" href="https://2023.aclweb.org/calls/main_conference/#paper-types-and-formats">ACL 2023 formatting requirements</a>. The reported research should be substantially original. All submissions will be reviewed in a single track, regardless of length. Accepted papers will be presented as posters by default, and best papers may be given the opportunity for a brief talk to introduce their work. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymised. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings. -->
      Authors should submit a paper <b>up to 8 pages (both short and long papers are welcome)</b>, with unlimited pages for references, following the <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Author_Guidelines" style="color:#2980b9;font-weight:400;">ACL author guidelines</a>. The reported research should be substantially original. All submissions will be reviewed in a single track, regardless of length. Accepted papers will be presented as posters by default, and best papers may be given the opportunity for a brief talk to introduce their work. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymised. Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings. <b>Preference for oral presentation slots in the workshop will be given to archival papers</b>.</li>
      <li> <b> Non-archival regular workshop papers: </b> This is the same as the option above, but these papers will not appear in the proceedings and will typically only receive poster presentation slots. Non-archival submissions in this category will still undergo the review process. This is appropriate for nearly finished work that is intended for submission to another venue at a later date. </li>
      <li><b>Non-archival cross-submissions: </b> We also solicit cross-submissions, i.e., papers on relevant topics that <i>have already</i> appeared in other venues (e.g., workshop or conference papers at NLP, ML, or cognitive science venues, among others). Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop, with an indication of original venue, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Cross-submissions are ideal for related work which would benefit from exposure to the <b>NLReasoning</b> audience. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format, and the submission length is determined by the original venue. The paper selection will be solely determined by the organizing committee in a non-blind fashion. These papers will typically receive poster presentation slots.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In addition, we welcome papers on relevant topics that are <i>under review or to be submitted to </i> other venues (including the ACL 2024 main conference). These papers must follow the regular workshop paper format and will not be included in the workshop proceedings. Papers in this category will be reviewed by workshop reviewers.</p>
   
   <p>
     <b>Note to authors: For archival and non-archival regular workshop submissions, while you submit your paper through OpenReview (<a style="color:#2980b9;font-weight:400;" href="https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/NLRSE#tab-your-consoles">link</a>), please select the "Submission Type" properly based on the guidelines. For cross-submissions, please fill out this form (<a style="color:#2980b9;font-weight:400;" href="https://forms.gle/BKn4bczXfaXN7GSg7">link</a>) and do NOT submit through OpenReview.
